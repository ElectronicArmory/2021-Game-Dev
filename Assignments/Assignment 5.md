# Game Dev Assignment 5 - Due Wednesday, June 30

## Base Requirements
Develop a 3D, top down, first person, or third person game and have some kind of win and lose condition. Use whatever Marketplace assets you want to. Free assets are perfectly fine and no money needs to be spent in order to do better on this game.

Use [this game jam theme generator](https://letsmakeagame.net/game-jam-theme-generator/) to come up with a theme, or choose **"No Weapons Allowed"** as your theme.

1. **Custom modeled mesh** for a Character (can be an existing model you've created). Does not have to be humanoid or your main character. (30%)
   1. **Animated** with 3 different animations/actions (must be your animations)
   2. **Armature** with at least 10 bones and the root bone (must be your rig)
   3. **Animation BP** with state machine or Blend Space (blend space is preferred for polish req and call this out in the developer video)
2. **Polish** - How well does your game work, feel and look? (30%)
   1. **Game flow** - Game starts, ends, transitions and moves along in a cohesive and smooth manner through menus, story introduction, end game scenarios, tutorials and other screens. 
   2. **UI** - Game transitions should be smooth (menus should fade in and out, pan, zoom, bounce or otherwise animate in).
   3. **Animations** - Enemies, items and other objects should have animations and not just simply appear, disappear, slide/move.
   4. **Look and Feel** - Game has a consistent look and feel and materials match and look consistent.
   5. **Immersive environments** - Through good lighting, sound, models, materials, animations, and good QA, the environment should not disrupt the player's immersion in the game.
3. **Fun or enjoyment** - Games should be fun. Impress me and make it an enjoyable experience. (30%)
   1. **Theme** - Does the game match the chosen theme?
   2. **5 Why's** - Do the game's objectives make sense such as the win/lose conditions, enemies, pick ups, HUD status, environmental aspects, etc?
   3. **Thoughtful** - Does the game make the player think, feel, question or become surprised during the game?
   4. **Replayable** - Does the game have any replayability? For games that have surprise endings, if playing the game again reveals additional clues that make sense, that would count.
   5. **Recommendation** - Would the player want to recommend this to a friend, add to their wishlist or want to find out more based on playing it, looking at the screenshots, or the video.
4. **Posted to Itch.io** account as new game with the following: (10%)
   1. **Screenshots** - At least 3 on Itch.io page.
   2. **Trailer video** - Around 30 seconds. First 5-10 seconds should be exciting gameplay, not logos or text. Hook the player first, then explain your game. End the video with them wanting to find out more.
